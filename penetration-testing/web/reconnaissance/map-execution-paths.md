# Map Execution Paths

## Check List&#x20;

* [ ] Map the target application and understand the principal workflows.

## Methodology

#### Path

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Use a proxy tool to map the target website by analyzing its sitemap, identifying all accessible pages, endpoints, and resources to build a comprehensive view of the application’s structure
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Perform a targeted analysis within the proxy tool by selecting a domain and running engagement tools to extract detailed insights about endpoints, parameters, and linked resources
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Configure a web application scan in the proxy tool, selecting a preset scan mode to crawl the target, enumerating URLs, and summarizing findings to identify hidden or sensitive paths
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Execute a directory brute-forcing tool with the target URL, filtering for specific response codes (e.g., 200) and targeting file extensions like PHP, ASPX, or JSP to discover hidden files or directories
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Run a directory enumeration tool with a comprehensive wordlist, testing for a wide range of file extensions (e.g., php, html, js, config, backup) to uncover sensitive files, backups, or misconfigured endpoints
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Analyze discovered paths for sensitive resources like configuration files (.conf, .ini), database backups (.sql, .db), or logs (.log), checking for exposed credentials or internal data
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Cross-reference enumerated paths with the proxy tool’s sitemap to validate findings, ensuring all discovered endpoints are tested for accessibility and functionality
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Document all identified paths, including URLs, file extensions, and response codes, to create a detailed proof-of-concept for responsible disclosure
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Assess the impact of discovered files or directories, such as exposed admin panels, configuration leaks, or backup files, to prioritize reporting based on severity
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Data Flow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Configure a proxy tool to intercept and map the target website’s sitemap, capturing all accessible pages, endpoints, and resources to understand the application’s structure and data flow
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Select multiple domains within the proxy tool’s sitemap and perform a targeted analysis to trace data interactions, identifying how requests and responses flow between domains, subdomains, or external services
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Examine HTTP requests and responses in the sitemap to identify parameters, headers, and cookies, mapping how data is transmitted across endpoints like forms, APIs, or redirects
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Analyze request chains to detect sensitive data (e.g., tokens, session IDs, or user inputs) passed between pages or domains, checking for improper handling or exposure
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Identify cross-domain interactions by reviewing Referer headers, CORS policies, or API calls, assessing risks like data leakage or unauthorized access to external services
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Inspect response bodies for sensitive information, such as inline JavaScript variables or hidden inputs, that may reveal internal data flows or configuration details
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Document all data flow paths, including request sequences, parameter names, and sensitive data exposures, to create a comprehensive proof-of-concept for responsible disclosure
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Assess the impact of identified data flow issues, such as exposed credentials, session mismanagement, or cross-origin vulnerabilities, to prioritize reporting based on severit
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

#### Race

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Configure a proxy tool to intercept and map the target website’s sitemap, identifying critical endpoints like forms, API calls, or resource-modifying requests prone to race conditions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Select a specific domain or endpoint within the proxy tool’s sitemap and use an extension designed for rapid request manipulation to prepare for race condition testing
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Send the selected request to a specialized tool within the proxy suite, enabling high-speed, concurrent request execution to simulate multiple simultaneous submissions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Modify the tool’s configuration to include a wordlist or parameter values, targeting inputs like session tokens, user IDs, or resource identifiers that could trigger race conditions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Execute the attack by sending multiple concurrent requests to the target endpoint, aiming to exploit timing issues that allow unauthorized actions, such as duplicate resource creation or privilege escalation
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Monitor responses for anomalies, such as unexpected success codes, data overwrites, or inconsistent states, indicating a successful race condition exploit\\
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Document the request sequence, timing details, and response outcomes to create a detailed proof-of-concept, including steps to reproduce the race condition
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Assess the impact of the race condition, such as unauthorized access, data corruption, or resource abuse, to prioritize reporting based on severity for responsible disclosure
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
