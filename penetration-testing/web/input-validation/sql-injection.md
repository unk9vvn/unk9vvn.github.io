# SQL Injection

## Check List

## Methodology

### Black Box

#### SQL Injection

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Identify all user input points in the target application, including form fields (e.g., login, search, or calculators), URL query parameters, cookies, HTTP headers, and POST request bodies
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Browse every feature of the application, such as calculators, profile settings, or data submission forms, to locate endpoints that likely interact with a database
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Intercept HTTP requests using a proxy tool (Burp Suite) to capture parameters such as `unitWeight`, `id` or `username`, especially parameters sent as JSON in POST requests and analyze how they are sent to the server
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Inject a single quote (`unitWeight=10'`) into a parameter and send the request, observing for a 500 Internal Server Error or similar response indicating SQL query disruption
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Add a second single quote (`unitWeight=10''`) to restore the query syntax, checking if the error disappears, confirming potential SQL injection vulnerability
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Test for time-based blind SQL injection by injecting a payload like `'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(10),0))XOR'Z`, noting a delay (10 seconds) in the response to confirm query execution
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Experiment with other SQL injection payloads (`' OR 1=1-- or ' AND SLEEP(5)`) to validate the vulnerabilityacross different input points, monitoring for consistent delays or response changes
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Actively trigger error messages by injecting invalid SQL syntax (`' or --`) in various parameters, analyzing responses for database-related errors or stack traces that reveal SQL usage
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Test URL parameters by appending SQL payloads (`id=1 AND SLEEP(5)`) to check if the server processes them in a database query, observing response delays or errors
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Inspect cookies by modifying their values with SQL payloads (`cookie=value' OR 1=1`), checking if the server responds differently or exposes sensitive data
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Analyze HTTP headers (`User-Agent` or `Referer`) by injecting SQL payloads, monitoring for errors or delays that suggest header data is used in database queries
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Examine POST request bodies, particularly form submissions, by injecting SQL payloads into fields like username or weight, checking for errors or delayed responses
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Use a proxy toolâ€™s repeater function to systematically test each parameter with SQL payloads, comparing responses to identify injectable points
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Time-Based SQL Injection

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Identify input fields or parameters in the target application, such as URL query strings (`id=`) or form inputs, that may interact with a database, focusing on features like search, deletion, or data retrieval endpoints
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Intercept HTTP requests using a proxy tool (Burp Suite) to capture parameters like id or username, analyzing how they are sent to the server for database queries
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Test for SQL injection by injecting a single quote (`id=187'`) into the parameter and sending the request, observing for server errors (500 Internal Server Error) that indicate unhandled SQL syntax
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Confirm the absence of verbose error messages in the response, noting generic error pages or no data leakage, suggesting a potential blind SQL injection vulnerability
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Inject a time-based payload (`id=187 AND SLEEP(5)`) to test for a delay in the server response, confirming time-based SQL injection if the response is delayed by the specified time (5 seconds)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Verify the delay by sending a non-sleeping payload `(id=187 AND 1=1`) and comparing response times to ensure the delay is due to the SLEEP command execution
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Test for boolean-based conditions using payloads like `id=187 AND IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)`, checking for a delay when the condition is true and no delay when false (`1=2`)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Extract database metadata by injecting payloads like `id=187 AND IF(SUBSTRING(version(),1,1)='5',SLEEP(5),0)` to determine the database version character by character, noting delays for true conditions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Determine the database name length using payloads like `id=187 AND IF(LENGTH(database())=10,SLEEP(5),0)`, incrementing the length value until a delay confirms the correct length
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Extract the database name by iterating through each character position with payloads like `id=187 AND IF(SUBSTRING(database(),1,1)='a',SLEEP(5),0)`, testing all possible characters (a-z, 0-9) and noting delays for correct matches
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Move to the next character position (`SUBSTRING(database(),2,1)='a'`) after identifying the first character, repeating the process until the full database name is extracted
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Test for additional metadata, such as table names or column names, using payloads like `id=187 AND IF(EXISTS(SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name='users'),SLEEP(5),0)`to confirm the presence of specific tables
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
